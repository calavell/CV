## Cathal Lavelle

A budding software engineer entering into the world of tech. After studying Business and French in Trinity College Dublin and subsequently working in the property sectorfor a few years, I decided to change my career trajectory. My career to date has largely circled around finding creative solutions to unique client issues.

In my short career, I have managed multiple small teams and aided with process implementation and training. I have juggled completing a part-time Masters in Human Resources management while working full-time. My experience with high value clients and people management has have taught me how to be creative ad well as invaluable stakeholder management skills. I am excited to see how I can utilise these skills on my new journey as a software engineer

I am excited by the area of Front-end development and how I can use my artistic side and creativity to build engaging and impactful web apps.
